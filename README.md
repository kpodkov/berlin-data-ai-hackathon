# Berlin Analytics & AI Hackathon

March 23, 2026 · Snowflake Office Berlin

A one-day hackathon exploring real-world streaming data with modern analytics tools. Build something meaningful from millions of real user interactions on the JustWatch platform.

## Getting Started

**Fork this repo** to your own GitHub account (or your team's). You'll be adding queries, dbt models, and analysis throughout the day — having your own copy lets you commit, collaborate, and keep your work after the hackathon.

```bash
# After forking on GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/berlin-data-ai-hackathon.git
cd berlin-data-ai-hackathon
```

## AI-Agent Friendly

This repo is designed to work with **AI coding assistants** — particularly [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). The repo includes:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — project context, data architecture, SQL patterns, and query conventions that Claude Code loads automatically
- **Lightdash skill** (`.claude/skills/developing-in-lightdash/`) — generates Lightdash explores, charts, and dashboards from plain-language descriptions
- **dbt skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — builds dbt models, runs commands, writes tests, and answers data questions — sourced from [dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills)

**How to use:** Open the repo in Claude Code (or an IDE with Claude Code integration) and start asking questions. The AI assistant understands the data schema, knows the SQL patterns for this dataset, and can generate dbt models and Lightdash dashboards for you. Describe what you want to analyse, and it will write the queries and configurations.

You don't need to learn the full syntax of every tool — the AI skills handle that. Focus on the analysis and storytelling.
