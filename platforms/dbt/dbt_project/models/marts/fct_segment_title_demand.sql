-- Grain: one row per (title_entity_id, user_segment)
-- Breaks title demand signals down by user segment, revealing which audience is
-- driving interest in each title. This bridges customer segmentation and content
-- licensing decisions:
--
--   binger rows   → AVOD acquisition signal (ad-supported audience)
--   whale rows    → TVOD acquisition signal (transactional buyers)
--   churn_risk rows → Retention-driven acquisition signal
