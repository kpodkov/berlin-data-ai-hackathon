-- Grain: one row per (title_entity_id, app_locale)
-- Breaks demand signals out by the user's CHOSEN market (app_locale), not physical location.
-- This is the correct dimension for cross-market licensing ROI analysis.
--
-- IMPORTANT: app_locale is the market the user selected in JustWatch (e.g. 'de_DE').
-- geo_country is where the request came from (e.g. 'FR' for a German expat in France).
-- Always use app_locale for market demand analysis.
--
-- Used by: mart_market_demand_gap (market entry scorecard)
